This intelligent traffic management system enhances road circulation, reduces accidents, and protects the environment. By utilizing pollution sensors, we can identify vehicles that emit excessive pollutants, which will be subject to an additional charge. To facilitate this process in a modern and efficient manner, we will implement cryptocurrency payments, recognizing that in 2025, digitalization is increasingly prevalent. The system will support Ethereum (ETH) payments, as it is widely accepted, and users will be able to complete transactions using a digital wallet, either a standard one or a virtual wallet such as MetaMask.

Our project is a smart traffic management system that aims to help drivers find the most optimal routes while taking into account sustainability factors such as air quality and road conditions. Through the use of AI, the system will assist in decision-making after processing the collected data. Additionally, accessibility to these routes will be based on a membership model, offering discounts to residents, further promoting the adoption of sustainable practices.

The system will also focus on centralizing data from sensor networks and surveillance cameras. These data points will enable real-time traffic flow monitoring, allowing the system to adjust routes and optimize traffic movement. By integrating surveillance cameras and smart sensors, the system will monitor accidents and traffic incidents, ensuring that the data is automatically transmitted to police departments. This will ensure that those responsible for accidents are held accountable promptly.

In terms of traffic flow management, the system will analyze in real-time the number of vehicles in a given area. If pollution levels exceed acceptable limits or wait times become too long, the system will dynamically update GPS routes, redirecting traffic across multiple alternative paths. However, the AI will be tasked with intelligently optimizing these routes to prevent congestion in other areas, maintaining a balance in traffic distribution.

On a large scale, the system requires advanced optimization techniques to ensure its efficiency and seamless operation. Key technologies employed in the system include Python, MongoDB, Azure Databricks, .NET C#, and React JS, which will work together to support the real-time processing of data, decision-making, and user interaction.

By integrating AI, sensor networks, surveillance systems, and blockchain for payment processing, this project aims to revolutionize the way cities manage traffic, promote sustainability, and ensure public safety.
